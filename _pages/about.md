I am currently an undergraduator in [School of Computer Science](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn/en/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), enrolled since September 2022. And I will continue my research in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/) in 2026, under the advisement of Prof. [Diyu Zhou](https://zhou-diyu.github.io/). 


# Research

I am specifically interested in Operating Systems, Storage System, Distributted System and Systems for machine learning. My current research focuses on software/hardware co-design and cache replacement.
